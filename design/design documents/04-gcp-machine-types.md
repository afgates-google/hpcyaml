You can retrieve a list of machine types available in a specific Google Cloud zone using either the gcloud command-line tool or the Google Cloud Compute API. Both methods offer a straightforward way to obtain this information.

Using the gcloud Command-Line Tool The gcloud command-line tool provides a simple way to list machine types and filter them by zone. The primary command is gcloud compute machine-types list. You can use the --filter flag to specify the desired zone.

Command:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --filter="zone:( us-central1-a )" Explanation:

gcloud compute machine-types list: This is the basic command to list all available machine types.

--filter="zone:( us-central1-a )": This flag filters the output to show only the machine types available in the us-central1-a zone.

You can replace us-central1-a with any valid Google Cloud zone.

You can also specify the zone using a slightly different filter syntax.

Alternative Command:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --filter="zone=us-central1-a" Additionally, the --zones flag can be used to achieve the same result.

Command with --zones flag:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --zones us-central1-a Using the Google Cloud Compute API For programmatic access, you can use the Google Cloud Compute API. The machineTypes.list method allows you to retrieve a list of machine types for a specific project and zone.

HTTP Request:

To use the API, you will make a GET request to the following endpoint:

GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/machineTypes Path Parameters:

project (string): The ID of your Google Cloud project.

zone (string): The name of the zone for which you want to list machine types (e.g., us-central1-a).

Example using curl:

You can use a tool like curl to make this API request. You will need to be authenticated to use the API.

bash curl
'[https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/your-project-id/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes](https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/your-project-id/zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes)'
--header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
--header 'Accept: application/json'
--compressed Replace your-project-id with your actual project ID and YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN with a valid OAuth 2.0 access token.

The response from this API call will be a JSON object containing a list of machine type resources available in the specified zone.

You can get a list of available machine types in a specific Google Cloud zone using either the gcloud command-line tool or the Google Cloud Compute API.

Using the gcloud command-line tool To get a list of available machine types in a specific zone, use the gcloud compute machine-types list command with the --zones flag.

Command:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --zones Example: To list the machine types available in the us-east1-b zone, run the following command:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --zones us-east1-b You can also use the --filter flag to filter by zone. Yaqs icon

Command with filter:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --filter="zone:()" Example with filter:

bash gcloud compute machine-types list --filter="zone:(us-east1-a)" Yaqs icon

Using the Google Cloud Compute API To retrieve a list of machine types using the Compute API, you can make a GET request to the machineTypes.list method. This method requires the project ID and the desired zone to be specified in the request path.

HTTP Request:

GET https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/zones/{zone}/machineTypes Parameters:

project (string): The ID of your Google Cloud project.

zone (string): The name of the zone you want to query.

Example using curl:

Replace [PROJECT_ID] with your project ID and [ZONE] with the desired zone.

bash curl
'[https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/zones/[ZONE]/machineTypes](https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/[PROJECT_ID]/zones/[ZONE]/machineTypes)'
--header 'Authorization: Bearer [OAUTH2_TOKEN]'
--header 'Accept: application/json'
--compressed For more details on the API method and its parameters, you can refer to the official documentation for the machineTypes.list method.

It's important to note that even if a machine type is listed, it might not be available due to resource exhaustion in that zone at a particular time. Yaqs icon Additionally, not all machine types are available in all regions or zones. Google Drive icon
