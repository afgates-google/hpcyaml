Configuring advanced networking features such as Tier 1 networking, Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC), and Cloud RDMA within a Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit blueprint YAML is accomplished by leveraging the toolkit's modular architecture. The blueprint YAML file defines the desired cluster configuration by specifying and customizing various modules, which are essentially Terraform or Packer configurations.

To enable these advanced networking capabilities, you need to specify the appropriate parameters within the relevant modules in your blueprint file. While the exact YAML syntax can vary depending on the specific module version, the following provides a guide on how to configure these features.

Enabling Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC) gVNIC is crucial for high-performance networking on Google Cloud. To enable it for the compute nodes in your HPC cluster, you will typically need to set a variable within the slurm_partition or a similar module in your blueprint.

A presentation on the Cluster Toolkit explicitly mentions a blueprint component for networking that includes "gVNIC installed" . This indicates that enabling gVNIC is a key feature of the networking modules.

Here is a conceptual example of how you might enable gVNIC in your blueprint's vars section or within a specific module's settings:

```yaml
blueprint_name: hpc-advanced-networking-cluster
vars:
  project_id: your-gcp-project-id
  deployment_name: hpc-cluster
  region: us-central1
  zone: us-central1-a

deployment_groups:

- group: primary
  modules:

  - id: network1
    source: community/modules/network/vpc

  - id: compute-nodes
    source: community/modules/compute/slurm_partition
    settings:
      machine_type: "c2-standard-60"
      enable_gvnic: true # This is a hypothetical example parameter
```
To find the exact variable name, you should refer to the documentation of the specific slurm_partition or compute node module you are using within the Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit GitHub repository.

Enabling Tier 1 Networking (100/200 Gbps) Tier 1 networking provides the highest available network bandwidth for your VM instances, which is essential for many HPC workloads. Enabling this feature often involves setting a specific network performance configuration.

For GKE clusters, Tier 1 networking is enabled using the --network-performance-configs=total-egress-bandwidth-tier=TIER_1 flag . This suggests a similar parameter exists within the Cluster Toolkit's Terraform modules.

Within a Cluster Toolkit blueprint, you would likely define a variable to specify the desired network performance tier. This could be a top-level variable or a setting within a network or compute module.

Here is a conceptual example:

```yaml
blueprint_name: hpc-tier1-cluster
vars:
  project_id: your-gcp-project-id
  deployment_name: hpc-cluster
  region: us-central1
  zone: us-central1-a
  network_performance_tier: "TIER_1" # Hypothetical top-level variable

deployment_groups:

- group: primary
  modules:

  - id: network1
    source: community/modules/network/vpc
    settings:
      tier1_networking: true # Another possible implementation

  - id: compute-nodes
    source: community/modules/compute/slurm_partition
    settings:
      machine_type: "c2-standard-60"
      network_config: # A more structured approach
        total_egress_bandwidth_tier: "TIER_1"
```
Again, the precise variable name and structure will be defined in the module's source code. You should inspect the variables.tf file of the relevant network or compute module in the Cluster Toolkit repository to identify the correct parameter.

Configuring Cloud RDMA Cloud RDMA provides low-latency, high-throughput communication between VMs, which is particularly beneficial for tightly coupled HPC applications. As of the latest information, Cloud RDMA is available on specific machine types like the H3 and A3 VMs.

Configuring Cloud RDMA within a Cluster Toolkit blueprint would likely involve selecting a machine type that supports it and potentially enabling a specific setting.

Here is a conceptual example:

```yaml
blueprint_name: hpc-rdma-cluster
vars:
  project_id: your-gcp-project-id
  deployment_name: hpc-cluster
  region: us-central1
  zone: us-central1-a

deployment_groups:

- group: primary
  modules:

  - id: network1
    source: community/modules/network/vpc

  - id: compute-nodes
    source: community/modules/compute/slurm_partition
    settings:
      machine_type: "h3-standard-88" # H3 VMs support Cloud RDMA
      enable_rdma: true # Hypothetical parameter
```
Finding the Correct Configuration Since the Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit is an open-source and evolving project, the most accurate way to determine the correct YAML configuration is to:

Consult the Official Documentation and Examples: The Cluster Toolkit documentation and the example blueprints in the GitHub repository are the best starting points.

Inspect the Module Source Code: The Cluster Toolkit is modular, with each module being a set of Terraform or Packer files . To find the specific variables you can set, navigate to the module's directory in the cloned repository (e.g., modules/network/vpc or community/modules/compute/slurm_partition) and examine the variables.tf file. This file defines all the input variables that can be set in the blueprint YAML.

By following this approach of examining the provided modules and examples, you can effectively configure advanced networking features for your HPC cluster using the Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit. Configuring advanced networking features within a Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit blueprint is essential for achieving high performance for HPC workloads. This can be accomplished by specifying particular settings within the YAML blueprint file that define your cluster. Below are the instructions for enabling Tier 1 networking, gVNIC, and Cloud RDMA.

Designing the Cluster Blueprint A Cluster Toolkit blueprint YAML file is structured to define the configuration of a reusable cluster. The core components of the blueprint are deployment_groups, which contain a set of modules that deploy and configure your HPC environment's infrastructure, such as compute nodes, storage, and networking.

To enable advanced networking, you will primarily modify the settings within the compute nodeset and network modules.

Enabling gVNIC and Tier 1 Networking Google Virtual NIC (gVNIC) is a virtual network interface designed for Google Cloud that offers higher performance compared to the standard VirtIO-based driver. Google Drive icon

Tier 1 networking provides even higher throughput (50/100/200 Gbps) for supported machine types and is a requirement for certain high-performance workloads. Google Drive icon

Enabling Tier 1 networking also requires the use of gVNIC.

You can enable these features within a nodeset module (e.g., community/modules/compute/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v6-nodeset) by using the bandwidth_tier setting.

To enable gVNIC: Set bandwidth_tier to gvnic_enabled.

To enable Tier 1 Networking: Set bandwidth_tier to tier_1_enabled.

YAML Configuration Example:

Here is a snippet from a blueprint's deployment_groups section, demonstrating how to configure two different compute partitions: one with gVNIC enabled and another with Tier 1 networking.

```yaml
# Copyright 2024 Google LLC

# ... (license header)

blueprint_name: advanced-networking-hpc-slurm
vars:
  project_id: "your-gcp-project-id"
  deployment_name: "hpc-cluster-1"
  region: "us-central1"
  zone: "us-central1-a"

deployment_groups:

- group: primary
  modules:

  - id: network
    source: modules/network/vpc

  # ... other modules like filestore, service accounts etc.

  # A compute nodeset with gVNIC enabled

  - id: h3_nodeset
    source: community/modules/compute/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v6-nodeset
    use: [network]
    settings:
      node_count_dynamic_max: 16
      machine_type: h3-standard-88
      bandwidth_tier: gvnic_enabled # Enables gVNIC
      disk_type: pd-balanced

  - id: h3_partition
    source: community/modules/compute/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v6-partition
    use: [h3_nodeset]
    settings:
      partition_name: h3

  # A compute nodeset with Tier 1 networking enabled

  - id: c3_nodeset
    source: community/modules/compute/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v6-nodeset
    use: [network]
    settings:
      node_count_dynamic_max: 20
      machine_type: c3-standard-88
      bandwidth_tier: tier_1_enabled # Enables Tier 1 networking

  - id: c3_partition
    source: community/modules/compute/schedmd-slurm-gcp-v6-partition
    use: [c3_nodeset]
    settings:
      partition_name: c3

  # ... slurm_login and slurm_controller modules

*This example is based on blueprint structures found in the official documentation. *

Important Considerations:

Machine Types: Tier 1 networking is only supported on specific machine types (like N2, N2D, C2, C2D, C3) with a minimum number of vCPUs.

gVNIC Requirement: To use Tier 1 networking, gVNIC must be enabled on the VM. The tier_1_enabled setting handles this requirement.

Node Images: Ensure you are using a node image that supports gVNIC, such as Google's HPC VM image or recent versions of standard OS images.

Enabling Cloud RDMA Cloud RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) over RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) provides low-latency, high-throughput communication for tightly-coupled HPC workloads. This is supported on specific machine families like the H4D series. Google Drive icon

To enable Cloud RDMA, you need to configure two main components in your blueprint:

VPC Network with RDMA Profile: The VPC network must be created with a special RDMA network profile.

RDMA-capable VM instances: The compute nodes must use a machine type that supports Cloud RDMA (e.g., H4D). Google Drive icon

YAML Configuration Example:

Configure the VPC Network for RDMA: You will need to modify the network module in your blueprint to specify the network_profile.

```yaml
# In your deployment_groups section
- id: network
  source: modules/network/vpc
  settings:
    network_profile: "rdma-network-profile-name" # Fictional example name
```
 You must create a VPC network with the RDMA network profile. You should consult the official Cluster Toolkit documentation for the exact variable name to set the network profile within the `modules/network/vpc` module.

2. **Configure the Compute Nodeset for RDMA:** Specify an RDMA-capable machine type in the `nodeset` module.

```
# In your deployment_groups section
- id: h4d_nodeset
  source: community/modules/compute/schedmd_slurm_gcp_v6-nodeset
  use: [network] # This network must have the RDMA profile
  settings:
    node_count_dynamic_max: 10
    machine_type: h4d-standard-192 # Example H4D machine type
    # Other necessary settings for RDMA nodes

- id: h4d_partition
  source: community/modules/compute/schedmd_slurm_gcp_v6-partition
  use: [h4d_nodeset]
  settings:
    partition_name: h4d
```

By combining these configurations in your Cluster Toolkit blueprint, you can deploy an HPC cluster optimized with the advanced networking capabilities required for demanding computational and data-intensive workloads.
