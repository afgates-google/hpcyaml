Research details Understanding the Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit Blueprint YAML Format The official documentation for the Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit blueprint YAML format outlines a structured approach to defining and deploying high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) environments on Google Cloud. A cluster blueprint is a YAML file that specifies a reusable configuration for a cluster, detailing the resources and settings required for deployment.

Key Components of a Blueprint YAML File: A cluster blueprint is primarily composed of the following elements:

Blueprint Name: This is a unique identifier for the blueprint. It's recommended to keep the name consistent when updating an existing configuration and to create a new name for a new setup.

Deployment Name: This name is used to label the cloud resources that are deployed, which helps in tracking costs and usage. While a single blueprint can be used for multiple deployments, the deployment_name can specify the intended use of a particular cluster.

Project ID: This is a mandatory variable that specifies the Google Cloud project where the cluster will be deployed.

Zone: This indicates the specific zone within a Google Cloud region where the cluster resources will be provisioned.

Modules: Blueprints reference modules, which are the fundamental building blocks for a deployment. These modules are typically Terraform or Packer configurations that deploy specific components like a cluster partition, a storage system, or network configurations.

Deployment Groups: These are logical groupings of modules within the blueprint.

How it Works: The Cluster Toolkit, formerly known as Cloud HPC Toolkit, utilizes an open-source tool called gcluster engine. This engine processes the blueprint YAML file, combines the specified modules, and generates a self-contained deployment folder. This folder includes all the necessary configurations and scripts (Terraform or Packer) to deploy the cluster.

Official Documentation and Resources: The primary official documentation for the Cluster Toolkit and its blueprint format is available on the Google Cloud website.

For a comprehensive collection of example cluster blueprints, the official Cluster Toolkit GitHub repository is the recommended resource. These examples serve as a practical starting point for creating custom cluster configurations.

The toolkit is designed to be highly customizable and extensible, allowing users to modify existing modules or create their own to fit specific needs. This modular approach simplifies the process of creating complex, repeatable, and best-practice-compliant HPC and AI/ML environments on Google Cloud.

The official documentation for the Google Cloud Cluster Toolkit blueprint YAML format can be found on the Google Cloud website and in the toolkit's GitHub repository.

Key Components of a Blueprint YAML File A cluster blueprint is structured with the following main components:

blueprint_name: This is the name of the blueprint and is used to label your cloud resources for easier tracking and cost monitoring.

vars: This section contains a set of global variables that are applied to all modules within the blueprint. Common variables include:

deployment_name: A unique name for each specific deployment of the blueprint.

project_id: The Google Cloud project where the cluster will be deployed.

region and zone: The geographical location for the deployment.

deployment_groups: These define logical groupings of modules that are deployed together. A blueprint can have multiple deployment groups. Each group contains:

group: The name of the deployment group.

modules: A list of modules to be deployed. Each module has the following attributes:

id: A unique identifier for the module within the blueprint.

source: The path or URL to the module's source code. This can be a local path or a URL to a Git repository.

kind: The type of module, which can be terraform or packer. The default is terraform.

use: A list of other module IDs that this module depends on. This allows the toolkit to pass outputs from one module as inputs to another.

settings: A set of key-value pairs to configure the specific module's variables.

terraform_backend_defaults (Optional): This section is used to configure a remote backend for storing the Terraform state, which is a recommended best practice for managing infrastructure as code.

toolkit_modules_url and toolkit_modules_version (Optional): These fields allow you to version your blueprints by specifying the Git repository URL and version for the modules used.

How it Works The Cluster Toolkit's gcluster engine processes the blueprint file. When you run the gcluster create command, the engine reads the blueprint, combines the specified modules, and generates a self-contained deployment folder. Google Drive icon

This folder contains all the necessary Terraform and Packer files to deploy the cluster as defined in your blueprint. You then use standard Terraform commands to deploy the resources to Google Cloud.

Resources and Examples You can find extensive documentation and examples to help you get started with creating your own blueprints:

Official Documentation: The Google Cloud website provides a comprehensive guide to the Cluster blueprint format.

Blueprint Catalog: A catalog of pre-built blueprints is available for various use cases, which you can use as a starting point.

GitHub Repository: The Cluster Toolkit GitHub repository offers a wide range of example blueprints. Google Drive icon
